The NEWEST UPDATE- ADDS A TON of Civilian cars to add variety to dynamic spawns of vehicles overall. Spawn rates should be fairly common for some models, less so for more luxury/solar variants. From crew-cab offroading premium five-seater pickup trucks with heaters to dune buggies and compact economy "Cube" cars, there's a bunch of vehicles to check out and scrap for parts.
